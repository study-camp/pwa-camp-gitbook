# Introduction

[PWA or "Progressive Web Apps"](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) is the vision put forth by Google to describe the web application experiences that are _fast, reliable \_and \_engaging_ -- making them "feel" like native apps to the mobile user. But what does this mean in concrete terms? And what are the tools, libraries and technologies available to developers, to build modern PWAs?

That is the focus of PWA Camp - content and roadmaps that can be used for self-study or in community-supported study groups, to get up to speed on PWA terminology, tools and techniques.

This GitBook serves as a **living document** that can be updated to stay current with new features, resources and best practices for PWA development. The document is loosely organized into three sections -- _Background_ that focuses on broad concepts and terminology, _Training_ that focuses on implementation support and processes for developers, and _Cookbook_ that captures best practices or insights as identified by industry case studies or developers.

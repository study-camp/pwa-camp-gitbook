## 1. What is a Progressive Web App?

A progressive web app is one that takes advantage of new and emergent technologies to provide a mobile web experience that is 

* _fast _\(is responsive to user events and renders smooth animations\)_, _
* _reliable_ \(loads quickly and is functional even under poor or absent network conditions\) and 
* _engaging _\(has immersive user experiences that compare favorably with that of native apps\)

From the user's perspective, the experience should feel familiar and natural on mobile devices, with the ability to do things like launch the app from the _Home_ screen, receive push notifications when the app is not actively in the foreground, and interact via full-screen user interfaces that don't show any of the browser chrome.

A "PWA" is not about a specific framework or library. Rather it is about a recommended approach for achieving such fast, reliable and engaging experiences - along with tools and libraries that can help developers achieve these goals in a consistent manner. In that context, some of the terms and technologies you will encounter in the context of PWAs include:

* [_App Shell Architecture_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)
* [_Service Workers_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/service-workers)
* [_Offline Storage_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/instant-and-offline/web-storage/offline-for-pwa)_ with _[_Cache API_](https://davidwalsh.name/cache)_ & _[_IndexedDB_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
* [_Web App Manifest_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/web-app-manifest/) 
* [_Web App Install Banners_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/)_ \(aka 'Add To Home Screen'\)_
* [_Web Push Notifications_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/push-notifications/)
* [_HTTPS _](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/encrypt-in-transit/why-https)\(critical for many PWA features, supports data integrity & secure communications\)
* [_HTTP/2_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/) \(faster, simpler, more robust HTTP\)
* [_The PRPL Pattern_](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/prpl-pattern/)
